# Just Another Redstone Gate Mod

1.3.0 Feature checklist:

✅ AND Gate - Is on when both inputs are on

✅ NAND Gate - Is off when both inputs are on

✅ XOR Gate - Is on when both inputs are different

✅ XNOR Gate - Is on when both inputs are the same

✅ OR Gate - Is on when either (or both) of the inputs are on

✅ NOR Gate - Is off when either (or both) of the inputs are on

✅ NOT Gate - Returns the opposite. On is off; off is on

✅ Long Repeater - Each tick is the length of a full normal repeater

✅ Multiplexer - Selects between two input signals and forwards it the output

✅ Switch (formerly Demultiplexer) - Takes a data and selector input. 
Changes which output to use based on the selector.

✅ Majority Gate - Is on when two or more inputs are on

✅ NEW! Intersection Gate - Takes two inputs, and relays them to the opposite side

✅ NEW! Half Adder - Takes two inputs, and adds them; produces a two-bit sum.
